This directory contains the following documents:

* ASET- Kerbin AEROCHARTS v17-11-25.pdf - This is a Jeppesen-style aerochart for stock Kerbin.  The charts
  include detailed aerodrome charts for both KSC and the Island Runway, as well as NDB and VOR radio
  station locations and frequencies.  All radio navigation beacons are fully supported by MAS.
  
* Changelog.md - The comprehensive changelog for MAS.  All changelogs prior to the current release of MAS
  are stored in this file.

* IndicatorADV_1_Scale_v0.2.pdf - an updated version of the IndcatorADV prop (the illuminated vertical
  bargraph style prop with a numeric display and a caption plate below the prop).  The updated version
  replaces the texture UV shift captions with a configurable text caption.  This manual was written with
  MAS in mind, so the config examples use MAS prop nodes.

* ModularPushButton_V0.2.pdf - a push button.  Multiple styles are available (single panel button,
  horizontal-split button, and vertical-split button, with many, many ways to change the appearance
  using colors and captions.  Multiple panel border / backlight options, and optional protective
  covers are included.  This manual was written based on RasterPropMonitor, so the config file author
  will need to convert these values to MAS.

* ModularToggleSwitch_v0.2.pdf - a mechanical switch.  Included are 5 different styles of lever,
  multiple switch guards, panel borders / backlights, and protective covers.  Three different colliders
  are available (single, for click-to-toggle; double; and triple).  This manual was written based on
  RasterPropMonitor, so the config file author will need to convert these values to MAS.

The latter two documents were written for RasterPropMonitor, but there are numerous examples already
converted to MAS, so it should be straightforward to translate the examples from RPM to MAS.
